## Description
It's an XKCD password generator featuring the Key-per from Adventure Time. It generates a password based on the parameters determined by the user.

## Demo
I will do my demo during section with Dan on Thursday.

## Details for teaching team
* I wanted to do a word scraper but could not figure out how the heck to understand regular expressions, so I gave up on parsing HTML. I did, however, have enough time to play a word association game with myself and manually type up an embarrassingly long array. 
* Annoying thing I kept running into between development and production: I include a refresh link for my lazy users. On my local server, I have to link to "/p2" in order for this to work. On the production server, I have to link to "/" for this to work. Clicking "/" on the local server brings you back to localhost/, while "/p2" on the production server tries to go to http://p2.beckrecca.me/p2 which does not exist.
